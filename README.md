# DEPRECATED, INTEGRATED WITH MARSEYLOADER

## Subverter

Marseyloader helper patch that allows loading custom code into the game.

### Building

1. Build or [obtain](https://github.com/Subversionary/StationAssemblies) game assemblies.
2. Reference Robust.Shared.dll in Subverter project
3. Build

### Usage

1. Copy "Subverter.dll" into the Marseyloader directory.
